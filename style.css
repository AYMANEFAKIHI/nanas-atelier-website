/* style.css */

/* You can add any additional custom CSS here that isn't easily handled by Tailwind,
   or if you want to override Tailwind defaults. */

/* Example: Basic hover effect for main navigation links */
/* This is already handled by Tailwind classes in HTML, but demonstrates how you'd add custom styles */
.main-nav-link:hover {
    text-decoration: underline;
}

/* More specific styles or component-level styles can go here */
/* For instance, if you want a very custom button style not achievable with Tailwind */
/*
.custom-button {
    background-color: #ff6347;
    color: white;
    padding: 10px 20px;
    border-radius: 5px;
    transition: background-color 0.3s ease;
}
.custom-button:hover {
    background-color: #e5533d;
}
